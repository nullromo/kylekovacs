## Projects

- I built a 5-DOF master/slave [robot arm](robot-arm/).

- This [laser galvanometer](laser-galvanometer/) can project user-drawn images using a laser pointer.
- I am making progress towards [Swashbuckler](swashbuckler/), a computerized version of my favorite board game.
- [Dungeon Gmae](dungeon-gmae/), the first video game I made.
- After that came [Equinox](equinox/).
- Template code for using [encoders with arduino](arduino-encoder/).
- I used to use [a custom web-scraper](mythic-updater/) to notify me of news updates, before they implemented a "sort by newest"-like feature.
- I keep [my .vimrc](vimrcgit/) and a vim colorscheme file in a git repo with a simple "installer" script.
- Another game I worked on is called [Islanders](islanders/).
- I built a [quadcopter](quadcopter/) from scratch.
- The [Bing Bong Belt](bing-bong-belt/) plays a xylophone according to a series of pegs on a belt.
