# Equinox

[Equinox](https://github.com/nullromo/Equinox) is a unique arcade-shooter style video game that I made with Collin Dutter many years ago.

## Quick Description

You control the **Equinox**, a sphere filled with **mass**. The more mass the Equinox takes on, the bigger it gets. **Enemies** will try to come and siphon mass from the Equinox, draining its lifeforce. You must use your **mass cannon** and **grapple cannon** to destroy and absorb enemies, respectively. But watch out! The enemies grow stronger by the minute... how long can you keep the Equinox alive?

## Thoughts

This project, our second major work, ended up a lot more polished than Dungeon Gmae was. Equinox comes complete with a tutorial, an options menu, a more complete game experience, a high-scores table, better graphics, and more originality. While Dungeon Gmae felt like an exploration of what computer programming was, Equinox is a work of art and mental effort that I truly am proud of. Of course, there is a lot that can be improved upon, and someday I hope to revisit and remake Equinox as a more complete mobile app.
