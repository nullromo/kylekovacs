# Compression Accelerator

I designed and built a hardware accelerator that attaches to RocketChip as a co-processor and speeds up the Snappy compression algorithm by a factor of 100.

## Details

[This repository](https://github.com/nullromo/compression-accelerator) contains the code for the accelerator.

Since this work was done for my MS thesis at UC Berkeley, I wrote a [paper](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2019/EECS-2019-85.html) about it. The paper is the easiest way to read more about the project.
