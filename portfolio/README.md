The files in this folder are descriptions of projects that I have worked on. Browse the files directly or see below for brief descriptions.

## Projects

- I built a 5-DOF master/slave [robot arm](robot-arm/).
- [Dungeon Gmae](dungeon-gmae/), the first video game I made.
- Template code for using [encoders with arduino](arduino-encoder/).
- I used to use [a custom web-scraper](mythic-updater/) to notify me of news updates, before they implemented a "sort by newest"-like feature.
- I keep [my .vimrc](vimrcgit/) and a vim colorscheme file in a git repo with a simple "installer" script.
