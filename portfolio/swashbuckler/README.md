# Swashbuckler

A computerized version of the 1980 Yaquinto board game. The main repo is [here](https://github.com/nullromo/swashbuckler).

## The Game

In Swashbuckler, players control pirates in a tavern brawl. Each pirate's goal is to be on the winning team by killing or forcing out all the enemy pirates (before the royal guard come in and shut down the fun). Players plot their pirates' actions 6 steps at a time, and then all actions are resolved before a new set of 6 steps are plotted. The result is a hilarious scene of playful bloodshed and broken glass that plays out like a drunken brawl amongst swashbuckling scallywags.

There is a lot of checking the rules and rolling dice in the physical board game, which can bog it down quite a bit. The planning sheets are also a little difficult to fill out. For these reasons (and for the reason of wanting to play with friends online) I decided to try and recreate the game digitally. This is the second attempt, and it is still a work in progress.
