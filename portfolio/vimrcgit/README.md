# vimrcgit

[This repo](https://github.com/nullromo/vimrcgit) contains the code, including the `.vimrc` file, the colorscheme file, and the "installer" shell script.

## Setup Instructions

I set up the "installer" to run as follows:

1. clone this repository and cd into it
1. execute `run.sh`
1. cd out
1. open vim and run `:PluginInstall`

This allows me to get my custom vim preferences onto any machine very quickly.
